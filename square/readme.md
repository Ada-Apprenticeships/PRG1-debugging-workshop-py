# ðŸŸ¥ Square

## Problem statement

In mathematics, squaring a number means multiplying it by itself. This operation is fundamental in many areas of mathematics and has numerous practical applications in fields such as physics, engineering, and computer science. We need a simple function that can calculate the square of any given number. This function should work with both positive and negative numbers, as well as zero, and should be able to handle both integers and floating-point numbers.

## ðŸ“‹Function Specification

We're implementing a function called `square` to solve this problem statement.

### Expected Behaviour

The function should:

1. Accept a single number as input (integer or floating-point)
2. Calculate the square of the input number (multiply the number by itself)
3. Return the result of this calculation

### Function Signature

```python
def square(num: float) -> float:
```

### Parameters

- `num` (float): The number to be squared (can be integer or floating-point)

### Return Value

- (float): The square of the input number

## Examples

```python
square(4)  # should return 16
square(-3)  # should return 9
square(0)  # should return 0
square(2.5)  # should return 6.25
square(-1.5)  # should return 2.25
```

## Buggy Implementation

Here's a buggy implementation of the `square` function:

```python
def square(num):
    num * 2

# Test the function
print(square(5))  # Should return 25, but will return None due to the bug
```

This implementation contains bugs that need to be fixed. Try running it and compare the output with the expected behavior described above. Can you identify and fix the issues?
