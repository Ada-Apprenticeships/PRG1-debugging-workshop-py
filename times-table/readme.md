# ðŸ§® Print multiplication table

## Problem statement

Multiplication tables are fundamental tools in mathematics education, helping students learn and memorize basic multiplication facts. These tables show the product of two numbers for a range of values, typically from 1 to 10 or 1 to 12. Creating such a table manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. We need a way to automatically generate a multiplication table for a given number, showing its products with a range of integers.

## ðŸ“‹ Function Specification

We're implementing a function called `print_times_table` to solve this problem statement.

### Expected Behaviour

The function should:

1. Generate a multiplication table for the given number
2. Print each line of the table to the console
3. The table should start at 1 and end at 12
4. Format each line as "a x b = c", where:
   - 'a' is the current number in the range (from 1 to the limit)
   - 'b' is the number for which the table is being generated
   - 'c' is their product

### Rules

- The function should work for any positive integer inputs for both parameters
- Each line of the table should be printed on a new line
- The table should start from 1 and go up to 12

### Function Signature

```python
def print_times_table(n: int) -> None:
```

### Parameters

- `n` (int): The number for which the multiplication table is to be generated

### Return Value

- This function does not return a value. It prints output to the console.

## Examples

```python
print_times_table(5)
# should print:
1 x 5 = 5
2 x 5 = 10
3 x 5 = 15
4 x 5 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
6 x 5 = 30
7 x 5 = 35
8 x 5 = 40
9 x 5 = 45
10 x 5 = 50
11 x 5 = 55
12 x 5 = 60

print_times_table(3)
# should print:
1 x 3 = 3
2 x 3 = 6
3 x 3 = 9
4 x 3 = 12
5 x 3 = 15
6 x 3 = 18
7 x 3 = 21
8 x 3 = 24
9 x 3 = 27
10 x 3 = 30
11 x 3 = 33
12 x 3 = 36
```

## Buggy Implementation

Here's a buggy implementation of the `print_times_table` function:

```python
def print_times_table(n):
    i = 0
    while i <= n:
        print(f"{i} x {n} = {i * 5}")
        i += 1

# Test the function
print_times_table(5)
```

This implementation contains bugs that need to be fixed. Try running it and compare the output with the expected behavior described above. Can you identify and fix the issues?
