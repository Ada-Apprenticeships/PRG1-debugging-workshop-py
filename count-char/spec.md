# ðŸ§® Count characters

## Problem statement

When working with strings, it's often necessary to count how many times a specific character appears within the text. This operation can be useful in various scenarios, such as analysing text content, validating input, or solving word puzzles. We need a function that can efficiently count the occurrences of a given character in a string, considering both uppercase and lowercase instances of the character as distinct.

## ðŸ“‹ Function Specification

We're going to implement a function called `countChars` to solve this problem statement.

### Expected Behaviour

The function should:

1. Count the occurrences of the specified character in the given string
2. Return the count as an integer
3. Be case-sensitive (treat uppercase and lowercase characters as different)
4. Count all occurrences, including consecutive ones
5. Return 0 if the character is not found or if the string is empty

## Rules

- The function should be case-sensitive
- It should work with any printable character (letters, numbers, special characters)
- It should handle empty strings correctly
- If the character is not found in the string, it should return 0
- It should count all occurrences of the character, even if they are consecutive

### Function Signature

```javascript
function countChar(str, char)
```

### Parameters

- `str` (string): The string in which to search for the character
- `char` (string): A single character to search for

### Return Value

- (number): An integer representing the number of times the specified character appears in the string

## Examples

```javascript
countChar("hello", "l"); // should return 2
countChar("Mississippi", "s"); // should return 4
countChar("Mississippi", "p"); // should return 2
countChar("Cassandra", "a"); // should return 3
countChar("Cassandra", "A"); // should return 1
countChar("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", "o"); // should return 4
countChar("", "a"); // should return 0
countChar("No matches here", "z"); // should return 0
```
